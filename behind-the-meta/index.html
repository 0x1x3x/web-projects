            <h2>Smart-contract development</h2>
            <p>
              Behind The Meta offers Full-stack blockchain development services including smart contract development and 
              consulting for both public and private blockchain.
              <br/><br/>
              The development of a smart contract, also known as its life cycle, goes through several phases. 
              These ensure that the business requirements are correctly defined and secured by the technology.In this case our developers provide the 
              best coding practices for smart contract security.
            </p>
            <h2>Smart-contract audit</h2>
            <p>
              
              We run tests to identify common problems, go through the smart contract code for verification and making 
              sure it matches with the documentation provided by the customer. We usually send a preliminary report to 
              the customer containing the main problems found. 
              This allows us to correct any other errors before publishing the final audit report.
              Our final report includes a detailed summary of the audit process, links to the audited smart contract, 
              and an explanation of what it does. 
              <br/><br/>
              The report then details the performed analysis and describes the 
              issues found in the contract including severity level. Based on code best practices, we propose improvements 
              which would enhance the contract code semantics. Finally, we wrap up the report with a conclusion which includes 
              a summary of 
              the most important items we noticed in the audit process.
