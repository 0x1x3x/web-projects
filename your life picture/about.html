            Social projects inspire such a high motivation for change and self
            realization that they are able to change realities of the society.
            Target groups supported by our organization include people of
            different ages, individuals with special needs, mild to severe
            disabilities, patients in psychiatric institutions and individuals

            open to everyone who considers the art as part of their existence.
            We provide a safe and open space for complex projects that unite
            people at risk, "outsiders" and professional artists as well as
            members of various public organizations.
          </p>

          <p>
            The multitude of our projects and programs creates a safe and open
            space that helps realize artistic ideas and pursue personal
            ambitions by bringing together, supporting and inspiring people from
            very diverse walks of life.

            <h3>Our Founder</h3>
            <img src="assets/img/our-founder.jpeg" class="about-us-img" />
            <p>
              Our founder Elena Schiffers lives and works in St. Petersburg. She
              studied theater theory at the Russian State Institute for
              Performing Arts in St. Petersburg. At the same time she worked as
              an actress at the Leningrad Youth Theaterand acted in movies.
              Elena also taught at the A.L. Shtieglitz Industrial Art Academy in
              St. Petersburg.
            </p>

            <p>
              In 2000, with the support of the leaders of the public
              organization "Perspectives" Margarethe von der Borch and Maria
              Ostrovskaya, she organized a theater studio at the psychiatric and
              neurological orphanage and nursing home in Peterhof. The work of
              the studio is based on the idea of the "House of the Dead Theater"
              introduced by Y.L. Schiffers, a well known theater director,
              writer and philosopher. His idea was based on the model described
              in the famous novel by F.M. Dostoyevsky "Notes From the Dead
              House". It is a small theater that does not have and does not need
              special effects, where the only instrument used to create a
              dramatic performance is a human personality.
            </p>

            <p>
              From 2004 through 2019, Elena was a coordinator of the theater,
              music and art studio program at the Perehof orphanage and nursing
              home. From 2007 to present, she works as one of the directors of
              the international "Theater Without Borders" project. In 2015 and
              2017, the shows produced through this project won national awards
              at the "Harlequin" festival in the prestigious people's choice
              nomination called "Through the Children's Eyes".
